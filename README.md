# 👨‍💻 Nameer Hanif's Coding Projects
**`Quick-witted Developer`**

👋 I'm Nameer, a Software Engineering Co-op student at Concordia University with a strong interest in AI and web development. All my coding projects are built from the ground up — **planning, designing, developing, and maintaining** solutions to tackle real-world problems through code.  I am currently exploring **Data Science 📊** through **Machine Learning 🤖**.
